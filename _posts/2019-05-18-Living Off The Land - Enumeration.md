## The Point

* As a Penetration Tester or Red Team Member and even a defender, it’s essential that
you understand how to use the various capabilities of a system that you’ve gained access to.
You may be thinking, I’ll just find a way to get a meterpreter shell on to the target. Well I hate
to burst you’re bubble but often times you won’t have that option. If you’re goal is to remain as
quiet as possible then your best bet it to use what’s already available.
It may be that you have limited access to the windows command line or an instance of
powershell. If you’re lucky it will be powershell, but once again that’s in a perfect world.
Personally, I want to be able to move throughout a system or target environment
without getting caught. Often times you won’t have the option to load your tool set on the
compromised host.

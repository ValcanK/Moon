## M3
* My name is Samuel and go by ValcanK/ILikeToHackThings. I'm currently a Lead Red Team Operator/Penetration Tester with a focus on Adversary Emulation. One of the most challenging things has been building a Internal Red Team from the ground up, no one ever tells you that turning your hobby into a job would be so tough. I would say that one of the best parts of what I do is working closely with the Blue side of security and helping them become better defenders.

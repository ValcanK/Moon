<center>Welcome to my blog.</center>

## M3
* My name is Samuel and I go by ValcanK/ILikeToHackThings. I'm currently a Lead Red Team Operator/Penetration Tester with a focus on Adversary Emulation. One of the most challenging things has been building an Internal Red Team from the ground up. It also doesn't hurt that I'm turning my hobby into a job, which has been very rewarding. I would say that one of the best parts of what I do is working closely with the Blue side of security and helping them become better defenders.

## What will be posted on this blog?
* The goal for this blog is to share various offensive security tips and tricks. The topics will range from technical to bigger view posts.
